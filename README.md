Top open in Visual Studio Community 2019:

1. Start the Visual Studio Community 2019 program.
2. Click the open folder button.
3. Navigate to the directory containing this file and open it.

You should be able to build, debug, run tests etc.

CMakeLists.txt projects are also supported in IntelliJ IDEs (e.g. CLion) and
with the cmake CLI utility available for all platforms.

The program expects to be run in the following way:

./imp1.exe edd path_to_file.txt
./imp1.exe erd path_to_file.txt
./imp1.exe spt path_to_file.txt
./imp1.exe wspt path_to_file.txt


Running a scheduling rule on a file without the data which is used to sort results in
undefined behavior, as the sorting algorithm used may be unstable when sorting equal values.

Files not containing the required values for the given rules will error.
